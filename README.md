# Video Summarizer

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive video summarization system. The project aims to support `English`, `Nepali`, and `Hindi` languages, allowing users to quickly extract relevant information from multi-lingual videos. The system utilizes `Natural Language Processing (NLP)`, video analysis techniques, and generative AI to generate concise summaries and visual representations of video content.
